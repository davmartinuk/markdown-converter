# Mega Movies

> A Vue.js project


## Build Setup

I decided to build this project in Vue JS due to the frameworks suitability for the task in hand. Vue JS is something I am picking up with each project so my approach may not be perfect – I am looking to improve here. I spent most time writing logic and less time on 
proper semantic HTML & CSS. 

I had a few problems with the Movie API, I couldn’t pull through the exact dataset required due to a key issue (it was saying I didn’t have permissions with my key). It was slightly baffling at the time so I moved on and pulled through a similar dataset and continued (with exactly the same key).

The UI is basic, the CSS/SASS is not setup correctly and there wasn’t really any thought of browser compatibility, responsive layouts etc. I used Chrome on a desktop only. It looks functional to me.

Webpack was used to bundle, this was the first time I have used this in all honesty. I liked it mostly! But it was a first effort so If I have done anything stupid here that is why.
 


## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
